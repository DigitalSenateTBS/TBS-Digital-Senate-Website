                    <h4> Psychotherapy Day</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you tell someone that you are celebrating Psychotherapy Day they will probably say ‘you need your head examined’ or some other joking remark, or maybe they will say that people who can afford psychotherapy don’t need a special day. Psychotherapy Day was founded in 2012 by a group of professionals and students and is designed to combat misconceptions and raise awareness of the vital work that is done by therapists in helping the one in four
people who suffer from mental illness as well as those with emotional problems. The colour turquoise is worn to show support for Psychotherapy Day and can be combined with their logo of a turquoise counselling chair on a black back-ground. It is an ideal time to talk, write, read or blog about psychotherapy in order to break down stigmas and worries, to volunteer or donate to community mental health centres and to share psychotherapy research.

                       Please do NOT use the corridor between block A and D on the second floor (to science lab) this week. There is a book fair this week and thus this corridor can not be used as a short cut nor to access the science lab.<br>
Many thanks, <br>

                    <p>
                  Don't forget that numbers in all workshops are limited so when you get the options slip next week make sure you include your first and second choice! <br>
If we have too many subscribed in one workshop we will draw names out of a hat to decide the pupils who will get that choice.
